                 REQUIEM GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                 ==============================

Everyone is permitted  to copy and distribute verbatim copies 
of this license, but changing it is not allowed. You can also 
use this wording to make the terms of other programs.

The following terms describe the limitations on copying, distributing,
using, or altering the REQUIEM sources which are protected by
this license.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the REQUIEM source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
and appropriately publish on each copy a valid copyright notice of the
form "Copyright (C) Mike P. Papazoglou and Willi Valder, 1991" with the
appropriate year; keep intact the notices on all files that refer to
this License Agreement and the absence of any warranty and the list of
original authors of each procedure; and give any other recipients of any
protected REQUIEM sources a copy of this License Agreement along with
the program.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the REQUIEM source code or
any portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under
the terms of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also cause the
modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the
files and the date of any change. If program binaries are distributed
or sold which are based in part on modified procedures, then such
modified procedures must be made freely available in source code form.
No restriction is placed on any new applications  which may be written and
used in conjunction with REQUIEM, though authors are
encouraged to make them also available under the terms of this
license.

3. You may use the REQUIEM sources in any program for any purposes
provided that you 

   a) Include in any documentation describing the program the notice:
   "This program is based in part on the relational database system
    REQUIEM  distributed free of charge by the Australian National University,
    Dept. of Computer Science, GPO Box 4, Canberra ACT 2601, Australia
    (c/o Mike P. Papazoglou) and which may be obtained by 
    anonymous ftp from anucsd.anu.edu.au"

   b) Include in any documentation describing the program a list of
   names acknowledging the original authors of any REQUIEM procedure
   used in the program.

   c) Acknowledge the use of REQUIEM or REQUIEM procedures in any
   description of the program including commercial advertising or
   articles in scientific journals. 

4. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer protected
REQUIEM procedures except as expressly provided under this License
Agreement.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, sublicense, distribute or
transfer these  procedures is void and your rights to them under this
License agreement shall be automatically terminated.  However, parties
who have received computer software programs from you with this
License Agreement will not have their licenses terminated so long as
such parties remain in full compliance.
